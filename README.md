This project demonstrates a custom dropdown component built using React. 
The dropdown component displays a list of items and allows the user to select one. 
The initial state of the dropdown button shows "Select," and this placeholder is not included in the dropdown list. 
The dropdown items are displayed on hover, and clicking on an item closes the dropdown and updates the button text with the selected item.
